# Ethics & legal checklist (must read)

Before running this crawler against any target, ensure you have:

- ✅ **Explicit permission** from the target owner when required.
- ✅ **Reviewed robots.txt** and complied with any disallow rules.
- ✅ **Confirmed compliance** with relevant laws (data protection, privacy, computer misuse).
- ✅ **Minimized data retention**: collect only necessary data; do not store sensitive PII.
- ✅ **Research approvals** (IRB/ethics committee) if data involves human subjects.
- ✅ **Rate-limiting and safety**: use DOWNLOAD_DELAY, AUTOTHROTTLE, and low concurrency.
- ✅ **Contact information** in your User-Agent string so admins can reach you.

- ✅ **Logging & monitoring** to detect unintended heavy load or errors.

If you are unsure about legality for a target, seek legal advice or avoid crawling it.
